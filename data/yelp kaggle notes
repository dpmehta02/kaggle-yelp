add all data into one file (make sure all data included, no errors)
re-run regression (include error measure)
add all data for testing
add regularization and validation?

We will use the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (“RMSLE”) to measure the accuracy of an algorithm.

ϵ=1n∑i=1n(log(pi+1)−log(ai+1))2−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√
Where:

ϵ is the RMSLE value (score)
n is the total number of reviews in the data set
pi is the predicted number of useful votes for review i
ai is the actual number of useful votes for review i
log(x) is the natural logarithm of x
